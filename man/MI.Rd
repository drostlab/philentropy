\title{Shannon's Mutual Information \eqn{I(X,Y)}}
\usage{
MI(x, y, xy, unit = "log2")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric probability vector \eqn{P(X)}.}

\item{y}{a numeric probability vector \eqn{P(Y)}.}

\item{xy}{a numeric joint-probability vector \eqn{P(X,Y)}.}

\item{unit}{a character string specifying the logarithm unit that shall be used to compute distances that depend on log computations.}
}
\value{
Shannon's Mutual Information in bit.
}
\description{
Compute Shannon's Mutual Information based on the identity \eqn{I(X,Y) =
H(X) + H(Y) - H(X,Y)} based on a given joint-probability vector \eqn{P(X,Y)}
and probability vectors \eqn{P(X)} and \eqn{P(Y)}.
}
\details{
This function might be useful to fastly compute Shannon's Mutual Information
for any given joint-probability vector and probability vectors.

There are two ways the \code{MI()} function could have been implemented.
\itemize{
\item Version one: \code{MI()} takes the the joint probability \eqn{P(X,Y)} as 2D matrix and then internally converts it to a joint probability vector \eqn{xy[i,j]} through indexing.
\item Version two: \code{MI()} takes the the joint probability \eqn{P(X,Y)} directly as probability vector \code{AFTER} the user converts their 2D matrix to a joint probability vector \eqn{{ xy[i,j] }}
} 
We chose to implement version two to give users maximum flexibility on how to define their joint probabilities.
